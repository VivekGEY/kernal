[Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/)
is an SDK that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) like
[OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction),
[Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service),
and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
with conventional programming languages like C# and Python. By doing so, you can
create AI apps that combine the best of both worlds.

## Seamlessly integrate LLMs into your existing code ‚ö°

With [plugins](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/plugins), you can define
[semantic functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/semantic-functions) (functions powered by LLMs)
or [native functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/native-functions) (functions powered by C# or Python)
so that you can seamlessly combine them together with Semantic Kernel. Once you've finished defining your plugins, Semantic Kernel makes it easy to
[mix-and-match functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/chaining-functions)
into a single pipeline with only a [few lines of code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/chaining-functions?tabs=Csharp#using-the-runasync-method-to-simplify-your-code).

What makes Semantic Kernel _special_, however, is its ability to _automatically_ orchestrate
[plugins](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/plugins) with AI.
With [planners](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/ai-orchestration/planner), you
can ask an LLM to generate a plan that achieves a user's unique goal. Afterwards,
Semantic Kernel will execute the plan.

## Getting started with Semantic Kernel ‚ö°

Semantic Kernel is available in a variety of languages and platforms. To get started, choose your preferred language below. See the [Feature Matrix](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/get-started/supported-languages) to see a breakdown of
feature parity between our currently supported languages.

</table>

The quickest way to get started with the basics is to get an API key
from either OpenAI or Azure OpenAI and to run one of the C#, Python, and Java console applications/scripts below.

### For C#:

1. Create a new console app.
2. Add the semantic kernel nuget `Microsoft.SemanticKernel`.
3. Copy the code from [here](dotnet/README.md) into the app `Program.cs` file.
4. Replace the configuration placeholders for API key and other params with your key and settings.
5. Run with `F5` or `dotnet run`

### For Python:

1. Install the pip package: `python -m pip install semantic-kernel`.
2. Create a new script e.g. `hello-world.py`.
3. Store your API key and settings in an `.env` file as described [here](python/README.md).
4. Copy the code from [here](python/README.md) into the `hello-world.py` script.
5. Run the python script.

### For Java:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel.git`
2. Switch to `semantic-kernel` directory and then checkout experimental Java branch: `git checkout experimental-java`
3. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/blob/experimental-java/java/samples/sample-code/README.md)

## Learning how to use Semantic Kernel ‚ö°

For a quick guide, you can check out the C# and Python Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks
demonstrate how to use Semantic Kernel with code snippets that you can easily run inline.

- [Getting Started with C# notebook](samples/notebooks/dotnet/00-getting-started.ipynb)
- [Getting Started with Python notebook](samples/notebooks/python/00-getting-started.ipynb)

**Requirements:** C# notebooks require [.NET 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
and the VS Code [Polyglot extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode).

Once you've finished the getting started notebooks, you can check out the main walkthroughs
