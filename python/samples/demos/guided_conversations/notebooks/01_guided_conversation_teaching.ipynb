    "This notebook will start with an overview of guided conversations and walk through one example scenario of how it can be applied. Subsequent notebooks will dive deeper the modular components that make it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivating Example - Education\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on an elementary education scenario. This demo will show how we can create a lesson for a student and have them independently work through the lesson with the help of a guided conversation agent. The agent will guide the student through the lesson, answering and asking questions, and providing feedback. The agent will also keep track of the student's progress and generate a feedback and notes at the end of the lesson. We highlight how the agent is able to follow a conversation flow, whilst still being able to exercise judgement to answer and keeping the conversation on track over multiple turns. Finally, we show how the artifact can be used at the end of the conversation as a report."

    "## Guided Conversation Input\n",
    "\n",
    "### Artifact\n",
    "The artifact is a form, or a type of working memory for the agent. We implement it using a Pydantic BaseModel. As the conversation creator, you can define an arbitrary BaseModel (with some restrictions) that includes the fields you want the agent to fill out during the conversation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules\n",
    "Rules is a list of *do's and don'ts* that the agent should attempt to follow during the conversation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conversation Flow (optional)\n",
    "Conversation flow is a loose natural language description of the steps of the conversation. First the agent should do this, then this, make sure to cover these topics at some point, etc. \n",
    "This field is optional as the artifact could be treated as a conversation flow.\n",
    "Use this if you want to provide more details or it is difficult to represent using the artifact structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context (optional)\n",
    "Context is a brief description of what the agent is trying to accomplish in the conversation and any additional context that the agent should know about. \n",
    "This text is included at the top of the system prompt in the agent's reasoning prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resource Constraints (optional)\n",
    "A resource constraint controls conversation length. It consists of two key elements:\n",
    "- **Unit** defines the measurement of length. We have implemented seconds, minutes, and turns. An extension could be around cost, such as tokens generated.\n",
    "- **Mode** determines how the constraint is applied. Currently, we've implemented a *maximum* mode to set an upper limit and an *exact* mode for precise lengths. Potential additions include a minimum or a range of acceptable lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a resource constraint could be \"maximum 15 turns\" or \"exactly 30 minutes\"."
