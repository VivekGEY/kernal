    "# A Battle of the Agents - Simulating Conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "A key challenge with building agents is testing them. Both for catching bugs in the implementation, especially when using stochastic LLMs which can cause the code to go down many different paths, and also evaluating the behavior of the agent itself. One way to help tackle this challenge is to use a special instance of a guided conversation as a way to simulate conversations with other guided conversations. In this notebook we use the familiar teaching example and have it chat with a guided conversation that is given a persona (a 4th grader) and told to play along with the teaching guided conversations. We will refer to this guided conversation as the \"simulation\" agent. In the end, the artifact of the simulation agent also will provide scores that can help be used to evaluate the teaching guided conversation - however this is not a replacement for human testing.\n"
