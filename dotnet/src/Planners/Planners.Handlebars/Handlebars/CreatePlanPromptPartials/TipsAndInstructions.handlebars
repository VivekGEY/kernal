## Tips and reminders
- Add a comment above each step to describe what the step does.
- Each variable should have a well-defined name.
- Be extremely careful about types. For example, if you pass an array to a helper that expects a number, the template will error out.
- Each step should contain only one helper call.

## Start
Follow these steps to create one Handlebars template to achieve the goal:
1. Identify Key Values:
  - Read the goal carefully and note any numbers, strings, or conditions that you'll need. Do not truncate or modify any data.
  - Use the `\{{set}}` helper to create a variable for each key value.
  - Omit this step if you don't need to create any initial variables.
2. Choose the Right Helpers:
  - Use the provided helpers to manipulate the variables you've created. Start with the basic helpers and only use custom helpers if necessary to accomplish the goal.
  - Always reference a custom helper by its full name.
3. Don't Create or Assume Unlisted Helpers:
  - Only use the helpers provided. Any helper not listed is considered hallucinated and must not be used.
  - Do not invent or assume the existence of any functions not explicitly defined above.
4. What if I Need More Helpers?
  - If the goal cannot be fully achieved with the provided helpers or you reference a hallucinated helper, print the following message: "{{insufficientFunctionsErrorMessage}}".
5. Keep It Simple:
  - Your template should be intelligent and efficient, avoiding unnecessary complexity or redundant steps.
{{#if allowLoops}}  - Avoid using loops or block expressions. They are allowed but not always necessary, so try to find a solution that does not use them.{{/if}}
6. No Nested Helpers:
  - Do not nest helpers or conditionals inside other helpers. This can cause errors in the template.
7. Output the Result:
  - Once you have completed the necessary steps to reach the goal, use the `\{{json}}` helper to output the final result.
  - Ensure your template and all steps are enclosed in a ``` handlebars block.

Remember, the objective is not to use all the helpers available, but to use the correct ones to achieve the desired outcome with a clear and concise template.
