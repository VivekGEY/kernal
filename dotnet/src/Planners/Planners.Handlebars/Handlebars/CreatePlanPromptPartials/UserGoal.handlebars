{{#*inline "UserGoal"}}
{{#message role="user"}}Please show me how to write a Handlebars template that achieves the following goal with the available helpers.

## Goal
{{goal~}}
{{/message}}

{{! Retry logic}}
{{~#if lastError}}

{{#message role="system"}}## Previous attempt
This previous plan failed to achieve the goal:
```handlebars
{{lastPlan}}
```

The error was:
```
{{lastError}}
```

Try again to achieve the goal while fixing the error.
