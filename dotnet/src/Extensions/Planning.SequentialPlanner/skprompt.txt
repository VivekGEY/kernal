Create an XML plan step by step, to satisfy the goal given.
To create a plan, follow these steps:
0. The plan should be as short as possible.
1. From a <goal> create a <plan> as a series of <functions>.
2. Before using any function in a plan, check that it is present in the [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS] list. If it is not, do not use it.
3. Only use functions that are required for the given goal.
4. A function has at least a single 'input' and a single 'output' which are both strings and not objects. Additional parameters may be required for some functions as defined in the [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS] list.
5. To save an 'output' from a <function>, to pass into a future <function>, use <function.{FullyQualifiedFunctionName} ... setContextVariable="<UNIQUE_VARIABLE_KEY>"/>
6. To save an 'output' from a <function>, to return as part of a plan result, use <function.{FullyQualifiedFunctionName} ... appendToResult="RESULT__<UNIQUE_RESULT_KEY>"/>
7. Append an "END" XML comment at the end of the plan after the final closing </plan> tag.

Here is an example of how to call a function "_Function_.Name" with a single input and save its output:
<function._Function_.Name input="this is my input" setContextVariable="SOME_KEY"/>

Here is an example of how to call a function "FunctionName2" with a single input and return its output as part of the plan result:
<function.FunctionName2 input="$SOME_KEY" appendToResult="RESULT__FINAL_ANSWER"/>

Here is an example of how to call a function "Name3" with multiple inputs:
<function.Name3 input="$SOME_PREVIOUS_OUTPUT" parameter_name="some value with a &lt;!-- comment in it--&gt;"/>
