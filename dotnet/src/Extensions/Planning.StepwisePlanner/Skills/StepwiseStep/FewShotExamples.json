    {"role": "assistant", "content": "[OBSERVATION] An Olympic-size swimming pool conforms to regulated dimensions that are big enough for international competition. This type of swimming pool is used in the Olympic Games, where the race course is 50 metres (164.0 ft) in length, typically referred to as \"long course\", distinguishing it from \"short course\" which applies to competitions in pools that are 25 metres (82.0 ft) in length, or 25 yards (22.86 m) in the United States. If touch panels are used in competition, then the distance between touch panels should be either 25 or 50 metres to qualify for FINA recognition. This means that Olympic pools are generally oversized, to accommodate touch panels used in competition."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "[FINAL ANSWER] An Olympic-sized swimming pool conforms to regulated dimensions that are large enough for international competition. The race course is 50 meters (164.0 ft) in length and 25 meters in width. The depth of an Olympic swimming pool is 2 meters (6 ft 7 in) minimum, 3 meters (9 ft 10 in) recommended. An Olympic swimming pool holds approximately 2.5 million liters of water with a surface area of approximately 13,000 square feet."}
