Create PowerShell script to satisfy given goal, using REST architectural style, with the available functions.

[AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS]

{{$available_functions}}

[END AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS]

To create PowerShell script, follow these rules:
1. The script should be as short as possible.
2. The script can use ONLY Invoke-RestMethod PowerShell cmdlet, any other commands are not allowed.
3. Before using any available function, check that it is present in the [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS] list. If it is not, do not use it.
4. Only use functions that are required for the given goal.
5. Function name should be used as Uri parameter of Invoke-RestMethod using following format: "sk://kernel/{FunctionName}".
6. If necessary, Invoke-RestMethod can return string result, which should be passed to the next functions to achieve the goal.
7. Return plain script, do not use markdown to indicate that it is PowerShell script or any other annotations or comments.
8. DO NOT define variables with constant values.

Example of valid syntax:
$result = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "sk://kernel/SkillName.FunctionName" -Method Post -Body @{input="test"}

Begin!
