# Implementing Feature Branch Strategy for Efficient Workflow

## Context and Problem Statement

In our current software development process, managing changes in the main branch has become increasingly complex, leading to potential conflicts and delays in release cycles. How can we streamline our workflow to ensure efficient and error-free development?

## Decision Drivers

- **Isolated Development Environments**: By using feature branches, each developer can work on different aspects of the project without interfering with others' work. This isolation reduces conflicts and ensures that the main branch remains stable.
- **Streamlined Integration**: Feature branches simplify the process of integrating new code into the main branch. By dealing with smaller, more manageable changes, the risk of major conflicts during integration is minimized.
- **Efficiency in Code Review**: Smaller, more focused changes in feature branches lead to quicker and more efficient code reviews. This efficiency is not just about the ease of reviewing less code at a time but also about the time saved in understanding the context and impact of the changes.
- **Reduced Risk of Bugs**: Isolating development in feature branches reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs into the main branch. It's easier to identify and fix issues within the confined context of a single feature.
- **Timely Feature Integration**: Small, incremental pull requests allow for quicker reviews and faster integration of features into the feature branch and make it easier to merge down into main as the code was already previously reviewed. This timeliness ensures that features are merged and ready for deployment sooner, improving the responsiveness to changes.

## Considered Options

- Community Feature Branch Strategy

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Feature Branch Strategy", because it allows individual features to be developed in isolation, minimizing conflicts with the main branch and facilitating easier code reviews.

### Consequences

- Good, because it promotes smaller, incremental Pull Requests (PRs), simplifying review processes.
- Good, because it reduces the risk of major bugs being merged into the main branch.
- Bad, potentially, if not managed properly, as it can lead to outdated branches if not regularly synchronized with the main branch.

## Validation

The effectiveness of the feature branch strategy will be validated through regular code reviews, successful CI/CD pipeline runs, and feedback from the development team.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Feature Branch Strategy

This strategy involves creating a separate branch in the repository for each new big feature, like connectors. This isolation means that changes are made in a controlled environment without affecting the main branch.

- Good, because it allows for focused development on one feature at a time.
- Good, because it enables small, incremental PRs, making review processes more manageable and less time-consuming.
- Neutral, as it requires a well-understood merging strategy to reintegrate changes back into the main branch.
- Bad, if branches are not kept up-to-date with the main branch, leading to potential merge conflicts.
